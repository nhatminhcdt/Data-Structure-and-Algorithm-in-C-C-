 * @brief [Task description](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/6-sorting/number_of_disc_intersections/)
 * 
 * We draw N discs on a plane.
 *  The discs are numbered from 0 to N ? 1.
 *  An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given.
 *  The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].
 * 
 * We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ÅÇ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).
 * The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:
 *   A[0] = 1
 *   A[1] = 5
 *   A[2] = 2
 *   A[3] = 1
 *   A[4] = 4
 *   A[5] = 0
 * There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:
 *  discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
 *  disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 *  int solution(vector<int> &A);
 * that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs.
 * The function should return ?1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.
 * 
 * Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.
 * @note assumptions:
 *  - N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
 *  - each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].
 *
